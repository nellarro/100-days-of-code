##Day 6: January 7, 2017
#### Kiss N Makeup


**Today's Progress**:
Still working on it but wanted to make sure I got something in here. Read up on the new Firebase Docs to see if Twitter authentication would be easier (it's not). Tried to fix some of the log-in errors like profile images not coming up if it's Twitter (yep, shade at Twitter right now). Trying to fix that atm. Ran <code>npm outdated</code>. 

**Thoughts**:
Never will I ever eject from <code>create-react-app</code> for the sake of Sass when CSS now has variables. Also, webpack dashboard is cool and all but can't deal with the crashing when the page refreshes more than 10x. Also, it's hard to come back to a project that you haven't touched in a while and look at everything with fresh eyes. It's like: "Who wrote this and why does it look like that?! Why did you write that method there?! What's wrong with you?!" And then you realize that it was you and you do one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. also <code>npm outdated</code> is a godsend!

**Goals**: 
Get images to show up.

## Day 5: January 6, 2017
#### Harley Quinn Photo Gallery (working title)


**Today's Progress**:
Unfortunately not a lot. Got <code>react-router</code> *sort of* working. Can't figure out why my button won't take the link route or change in the address bar. 

**Thoughts**:
A little frustrating but I'm excited to continue tackling it tomorrow after I get some [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/check-for-palindromes) in!

**Goals**:
Tackle this 100%.

## Day 4: January 5, 2017
#### Harley Quinn Photo Gallery (working title)
#### Jr_Dev_Resource (a twitterbot)


**Today's Progress**:
Tinkered with my twitterbot for a few minutes so that it could run while I was working on the Harley project. Added <code>react-router</code> *finally*. Added gradients to the top and bottom of landing page to make it look completely like an Arkham thing. Added more fonts. Set up component layouts for the rules of the game as well as the <code>App</code> component.

**Thoughts**:
Since it is only a layout, it looks kind of janky to the naked eye right now code-wise. Visually it looks like it's supposed to do. It even has a little note from Harley in the console which is pretty nifty.

**Goals**:
Completely implement <code>react-router</code> and wireframing the two next JS file.

## Day 3: January 4, 2017
#### Harley Quinn Photo Gallery (working title)

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the form as boring as I could make it! Added the bones of a motto at the bottom as a footer. More "styling".

**Thoughts**:
It is really taking EVERYTHING in me not to make the landing page look better. Right now it looks terrible (because it's meant to look like a low budget, couldn't care less, Arkham Asylum corporate log-in page). I'm pretty proud of it so far.

**Goals**:
Officially link in that Router to the submit button!

## Day 2: January 3, 2017
#### Harley Quinn Photo Gallery (working title)

**Today's Progress**:
More design. Progress was a bit slower due to working on a FreeCodeCamp thing prior that gave me a brain fart.

**Thoughts**:
I am excited with its progress so far but I definitely need to put in more time.

**Goals**:
Get the landing page completely finished by tomorrow!

## Day 1: January 2, 2017
#### Harley Quinn Photo Gallery (working title)

**Today's Progress**:
What I did was create the bare bones of the landing page so it has an input field where an "administrator" can submit their username and password to get to the inmate database.


**Thoughts**:
Got started a little late but decided to re-do one of my favorite web applications. The old one uses create-react-app out of the box from about 4 months ago so it is a little outdated. It also does not have React Router. I'm pretty excited about it!

**Goals**:
Still need to work on a lot of design choices and then will implement TypeJS and React Router on the submit button.

## Day 0: January 1, 2017
#### JavaScript Koans

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp during the day until 5:09 and then took a break to do JavaScript Koans and time myself. 5 out of 8 completed by 6:20. 4 checked by Jasmine.

**Thoughts:** Pretty excited about how well I did. I remember when the entire koan took me about 5 hours. Positive things that I noticed- I understand arr.shift(), arr.unshift(), arr.pop(), and arr.push() a ton more than what I did before! Needs improvement: lexical scopaing and arr.slice().

**Goals:** Make JavaScript Koans part of my weekly ritual. Each Sunday, I'll repeat koans from scratch and see if my time gets better and what things I understand more.
