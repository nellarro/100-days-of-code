# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 1, 2017
#### JavaScript Koans

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp during the day until 5:09 and then took a break to do JavaScript Koans and time myself. 5 out of 8 completed by 6:20. 4 checked by Jasmine.

**Thoughts:** Pretty excited about how well I did. I remember when the entire koan took me about 5 hours. Positive things that I noticed- I understand arr.shift(), arr.unshift(), arr.pop(), and arr.push() a ton more than what I did before! Needs improvement: lexical scopaing and arr.slice().

**Goals:** Make JavaScript Koans part of my weekly ritual. Each Sunday, I'll repeat koans from scratch and see if my time gets better and what things I understand more.
