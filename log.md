# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 1, 2017
#### JavaScript Koans

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp during the day until 5:09 and then took a break to do JavaScript Koans and time myself. 5 out of 8 completed by 6:20. 4 checked by Jasmine.

**Thoughts:** Pretty excited about how well I did. I remember when the entire koan took me about 5 hours. Positive things that I noticed- I understand arr.shift(), arr.unshift(), arr.pop(), and arr.push() a ton more than what I did before! Needs improvement: lexical scopaing and arr.slice().

**Goals:** Make JavaScript Koans part of my weekly ritual. Each Sunday, I'll repeat koans from scratch and see if my time gets better and what things I understand more.

## Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
What I did was create the bare bones of the landing page so it has an input field where an "administrator" can submit their username and password to get to the inmate database.


**Thoughts**:
Got started a little late but decided to re-do one of my favorite web applications. The old one uses create-react-app out of the box from about 4 months ago so it is a little outdated. It also does not have React Router. I'm pretty excited about it!

**Goals**:
Still need to work on a lot of design choices and then will implement TypeJS and React Router on the submit button.

## Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
More design. Progress was a bit slower due to working on a FreeCodeCamp thing prior that gave me a brain fart.

**Thoughts**:
I am excited with its progress so far but I definitely need to put in more time.

**Goals**:
Get the landing page completely finished by tomorrow!
